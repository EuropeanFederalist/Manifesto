# Manifesto for a Federal Europe: A United States of Europe
1. **A Central Government Modeled After the United States**
In recognition of the enduring success of the United States’ federal structure—and as a compliment to America’s democratic principles—we propose a similarly modeled central government for Europe. This approach provides a familiar framework for understanding governmental roles, ensuring both clarity and efficiency in decision-making.

2. **Bicameral Legislature: Parliament and Senate**
To represent European citizens and member states fairly, the new federal system would adopt a two-chamber legislature:

     -**Parliament (House of the People)**: Elected by European citizens based on population, ensuring that each individual’s voice is proportionally represented.
   
     -**Senate (House of the States)**: Composed of representatives from each member state, giving every nation—large or small—a meaningful role in shaping federal policy.
Laws and policies would require a majority in both the Parliament and the Senate to pass, replacing the outdated unanimity requirement. This structure respects the principle of “shared sovereignty,” striking a balance between majority rule and state interests.

4. **European Debt Guaranteed by the European Central Bank (ECB)**
Under the new federal government, Europe will issue joint debt (“Eurobonds”) backed by the European Central Bank. Centralizing debt issuance lowers interest rates, attracts global investors, and streamlines economic governance. This unified financial framework undergirds economic stability, supports strategic investments, and fortifies confidence in the euro.

5. **Empowering the ECB for Economic Resilience**
While ensuring democratic oversight through the federal government, the ECB maintains its crucial independence in safeguarding price stability. With clearly defined authority to respond to economic turbulence, the ECB can bolster employment, manage inflation, and provide a stable monetary foundation for sustainable growth.

6. **A Strong Defense and Common Foreign Policy**
Europe’s security demands a unified defense and single foreign policy apparatus. Pooling intelligence and military resources under federal guidance not only counters emerging global threats but also strengthens the continent’s influence on the world stage. By allocating defense resources through a centralized mechanism, the European federation gains strategic coherence, improves cost efficiency, and ensures that all member states benefit from collective security.

7. **France’s Historic Transition: Atomic Defense and Security Council Seat**
Recognizing the importance of unity in global affairs, France will transfer control of its nuclear arsenal to the central European government. This ensures that Europe’s nuclear deterrent is collectively governed and responsibly managed in line with unified strategic principles. In a profound display of solidarity, France’s permanent seat on the United Nations Security Council will likewise represent the entire federation, reflecting Europe’s single foreign policy voice and shared obligations on the global stage.

8. **Respect for Member States and Individual Freedoms**
In line with the U.S. model of federalism, each European nation retains autonomy in social, cultural, and domestic matters, preserving local traditions and upholding the distinct identities of member states. Federal law also protects fundamental personal liberties—freedom of speech, assembly, and expression—across the Union, reinforcing democracy and countering populist narratives.

9. **Low Bureaucracy, High Investment**
A streamlined federal government, free of excessive red tape, can efficiently direct resources to critical pan-European projects. From major infrastructure upgrades to research in renewable energy and emerging technologies like artificial intelligence (AI), a centralized approach to large-scale funding enhances competitiveness, fosters innovation, and creates equitable opportunities throughout the continent.

10. **Environmental Leadership and Responsibility**
As a united federal entity, Europe can more effectively address climate change, implement bold environmental policies, and invest in green technologies. Guided by robust federal legislation, these initiatives secure a sustainable future, reduce reliance on fossil fuels, and stimulate new economic sectors—while ensuring that regulations remain predictable and fair.

11. **Humanitarian Values and Global Solidarity**
Adhering to Kant’s categorical imperative of universal moral responsibility, the European federation pledges to protect fundamental human rights, defend refugees, and promote global cooperation. With an integrated refugee policy and equitable resource-sharing, Europe provides humanitarian support without overburdening any single region. Engaging proactively with international partners, the federation also encourages all nations to do their fair share, further strengthening global stability.

12. **A Forward-Looking Vision for Europe and the World**
By drawing inspiration from the United States’ constitutional legacy—adopting a bicameral legislature, transferring France’s nuclear and diplomatic prerogatives to a central authority, and issuing joint debt guaranteed by the ECB—Europe strengthens its capacity to act decisively. This new federal framework sets the stage for a more secure, prosperous, and influential Europe. United in governance and spirit, we honor our diverse national traditions while forging a shared destiny that promises peace, progress, and democratic values for future generations.
